Our task is to improve the basic model from Heart such that the model can 
find not only the object image, but also the images containing the object as an embedding. 
There are currently several models that can appropriate identify relevant objects in a single 
image and the localization of the objects. We will try to implement them with our selected data (handbag dataset) for 
Hearst fashion magazine and compare their performance and accuracy.

We have met with two mentors, Rahel Jhirad and Hao Han, from Heast to discuss the project details and their requirements. 
Unfortunately, we are unable to get Hearst internal data for model training. However, there are huge Handbag images on internet
that we can use. We filter out around 2,100 handbag images from the Open Images Dataset V4 with label. The sample dataset can be 
found in the sample_data folder. Next, we researched on several object detection algorithms such as R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, Yolo and SSD.
We wish to try those algorithms with a sub sample data. Since each algorithms have their own structure, we need to convert data annotations
to an acceptable format for each model. Currently, we have done data preprocessing for SSD and trained in a sub sample set. And we 
are now working on YOLO. Finally, we will run all algorithms on full handbag dataset, construct a system that records the performance 
and evaluation score and test the best model on Hearst Handbag dataset. If we have enough time, we will construct a handbag brand 
detection model for Heast.
