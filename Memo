Our task is to improve the basic model from Heart such that the model can find not only the object image, 
but also the images containing the object as an embedding. There are currently several models that can 
appropriate identify relevant objects in a single image and the localization of the objects. We will try 
to implement them with our selected data (handbag dataset) for Hearst fashion magazine and compare their 
performance and accuracy.

We have met with two mentors, Rahel Jhirad and Hao Han, from Heast to discuss the project details and their 
requirements. Unfortunately, we are unable to get Hearst internal data for model training. Open Images Dataset 
V4 contains 1.9M images of 600 categories. We filtered out around 2,100 handbag images from the Open Images Dataset
V4 with label. The sample dataset can be found in the sample_data folder. Next, we researched on several object 
detection algorithms such as R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, Yolo and SSD. We wish to try those algorithms with a subsample data.
Since each algorithms have their own structure, we need to convert data annotations to an acceptable format for each
model. We have done data preprocessing for SSD and trained on a sub sample set, and currently we are working 
on YOLO. Finally, we will run all algorithms on full handbag dataset, construct a system that records the performance 
and evaluation score and test the best model on Hearst Handbag dataset. If we have enough time, we will construct a 
handbag brand detection model for Heast.
